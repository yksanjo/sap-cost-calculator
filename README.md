sap-cost-calculator is a finance-focused project that evaluates transaction and cost signals to improve financial controls and decision quality.  
This repository now includes a runnable baseline implementation, tests, and architecture documentation for production-oriented development.

## Problem Statement

Teams need fast, deterministic signals to prioritize work and reduce operational risk.

## Solution Overview

This project ingests runtime signals, computes a deterministic score, and emits structured results for downstream workflows.
